<p>Sazerac is a New Orleans based alcoholic beverage manufacturer and importer. The company&#39;s portfolio ranges from extremely high end whiskies such as Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon and Glenfarclas Scotch to Rain, a line of organic vodkas, to popular shooter brands such as Fireball Whisky and Dr. McGillicuddy&#39;s Liqueur.</p>
<p>The Sazerac Gift Shop was created to sell merchandise for the products used to make the Sazerac Cocktail, the drink from which the company&#39;s name comes.</p>
<p>The site was built using a highly customized template on top of the ZenCart e-commerce platform. Products were broken down into 4 broad categories:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Glassware &amp; Bar Tools</li>
	<li>Bitters</li>
	<li>Clothing</li>
	<li>Gift Items</li>
</ol>

<p>The look and feel of the site is deliberately &quot;Retro&quot; given the history of the drink. Many customization were made to the site including installation of the USPS module to pull in real-time shipping quotes based on weight, and integration of jQuery lightbox plugin for zooming in on product images.</p>

<p>The site has become a focal point of the marketing activities for the brands featured, and has been expanded, building a separate portal for customers looking to buy wholesale quantities of bitters</p>
