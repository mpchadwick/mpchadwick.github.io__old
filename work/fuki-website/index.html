<p>Fu-Ki is a premium alcohol brand imported from Japan with a line of products that includes a Junmai Sake, a Plum Wine, a Cherry Wine, and a Green Tea Wine. With an average annual growth rate of 4% in the Sake category since 2005, the brand needed an online presence to prove it&#39;s legitimacy.</p>
<p>My agency, <a href="http://www.ccmthinkimpact.com" target="_blank">CCM Marketing</a> was awarded the project and, based on my 2 and a half years experience living in Japan, and knowledge of the culture I quickly became involved.</p>
<p>Working with the agency&#39;s chief creative director, we decided on three broad content categories for the site:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>About Fu-Ki:</b> Product information such as serving sugestions, food pairings, tasting notes and ingredients</li>
	<li><b>Sake Education:</b> Educational content such information about the Sake production process, history and varieties</li>
	<li><b>Drink Recipes:</b> Drink recipes for each product</li>
</ol>
<p>Using those broad categories as a base, key topics for the site were selected and a sitemap was developed.</p>

<p>Next wireframes were developed for each visually distinct section of the site, and then high-fidelity mock-ups were created.</p>
<p>The site was built using a custom WordPress theme so that the client could easily update the content. In addition, mobile views for each page were created using jQuery mobile.</p>

<p>The site was widely lauded by everyone at Fu-Ki and has become an invaluable asset to the brand.</p>
