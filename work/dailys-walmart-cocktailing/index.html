<p>Daily&#39;s Cocktails is a popular brand of pre-mixed cocktails and cocktail mixers manufactured just outside of Pittsburgh, PA. Long time partners of my agency, <a href="http://www.ccmthinkimpact.com" target="_blank">CCM Marketing</a>, Daily&#39;s called upon us to develop a unique co-marketing platform for the brand to present to Walmart, their biggest customer.</p>
<p>&quot;How Are You Cocktailing&quot; was decided upon as a theme by the agency and the client. Under the usual agency time crunch, I developed branding elements for the theme including a logo, font faces, color schemes and patterns. Then, I quickly churned out high-fidelity mock-ups of a Facebook page in desktop view, a microsite in mobile view, a 300x250 digital ad unit and a tweet based on that branding.</p>

<p>The mockups were extremely well received by Daily&#39;s and among other items including in-store displays and print advertising were placed in a powerpoint that was ultimately presented to Walmart. </p>
