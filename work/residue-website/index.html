<p>Joel Shawn in an independent musician from Canada who has released nearly 20 recording projects. Residue Music, released in 2012, was the first project to have a dedicated website, which I developed for Joel in a freelance arrangement.</p>
<p>The look and feel of the website was created to match the handmade feel of Joel&#39;s music and utilizes many elements from the CD packaging.</p>
<p>After the look and feel was established, through photoshop mock-ups. I began building a custom WordPress theme, so that Joel could edit the site himself.</p>
<p>The website is mainly text based, and is all loaded on a single page, and uses a custom page template that grabs content from different entries on the back end. It uses the SoundManager 2 library so that users can preview all the tracks from the album, and also includes a PayPal buy now button so that users can buy the button.</p>
<p>Joel has used the site to publish upcoming events such as concerts he performs, and also posted a length biography to the &quot;About&quot; section.</p>
