<p>CCM is a New York City based full service marketing agency. I began working at CCM as an account coordinator in May of 2011. My first major web development / web design project was a redesign of the agency&#39;s outdated flash site.</p>
<p>After many strategic internal meetings a bold, new tagline was decided upon: &quot;Thought. Deed. IMPACT.&quot;, replacing the agency&#39;s previous tagline, &quot;Independent Thinking from an Independent Agency&quot;.</p>
<p>Given the new direction of the tagline, I proposed this dramatic blue and white color scheme, and the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Permanent+Marker" target="_blank">Permanent Marker</a> font face for headers, complemented by Verdana for body copy. The look was deliberately kept simple and minimally decorated to best showcase the agency&#39;s superb creative work.</p>

<p>The website data is stored in a MySQL database and custom PHP templates were created to pull in the content. The home page also utilized the Twitter API to pull in a live feed of tweets.</p>
<p>The site has been a key tool for business development at the agency since, and was a major stepping stone after which I became the go to person at the agency on digital projects.</p>
