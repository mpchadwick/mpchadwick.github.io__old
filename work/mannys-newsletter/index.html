<div class="caption">Manny&#39;s &quot;The Daily Bark&quot; Newsletter</div>
<p>Manny&#39;s On Second is New York City based sports bar with 24 beer taps, 40 TVs and some of the best wings in the city. The bar takes its from Manny, the all black French Bulldog pet of the bar&#39;s owner, John.</p>
<p>The bar spent a couple of years building its database of roughly 4,500 email addresses in preparation for an ongoing email marketing campaign, which was launched in May of 2013.</p>
<p>One of the big decisions up front was to use responsive email design. Using a mobile first strategy, the client was presented with mobile and desktop mock-ups of the newsletter prior to any coding.</p>
<p>The second consideration was Manny, the bar&#39;s loveable mascot. Everything from the name, &quot;The Month Barkly&quot;, to the typography choices, to visual elements such as pawprints were selected to give the newsletter a fun-loving feel.</p>
<p>While the bar was extremely satisfied with the design of the newsletter, the response rate from the database was lower than expected and the campaign was discontinued shortly after launch.</p>
