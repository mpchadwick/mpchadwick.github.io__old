<p>Buffalo Trace is a popular brand of bourbon distributed worldwide. The Buffalo Trace Online Gift Shop is an extension of the physical gift shop, which is located at the Buffalo Trace distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Bourbon enthusiasts can buy Buffalo Trace merchandise including t-shirt, glassware, food items, and signage. 
<p>At <a href="www.ccmthinkimpact.com" target="_blank">CCM</a>, I was in charge of migrating the site from the existing buggy VevoCart platform to a new platform. We were experiencing many issues with VevoCart including issues with checkout in old IE, the inability to integrate PayPal Express checkout, and the inability to manage inventory based on product attribute</p>

<p>I chose to build the website on the ZenCart platform, which I had also used for <a href="{{site.url}}/work/the-sazerac-gift-shop">The Sazerac Gift Shop</a>. I was able to utilize much of the existing CSS code and HTML structure that had been developed for the VevoCart platform, but needed to manually integrate into a custom PHP template.</p>
<p>The transition occured seamlessly and will likely result in increased sales eliminating abandoned carts by frustrated users who encountered the bug purchasing with old IE.</p>
