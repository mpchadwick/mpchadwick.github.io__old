<div class="caption">Little Hug Barrel Full of Cash promotional microsite</div>
<p>In the summer of 2013, Little Hug, a kids fruit drink product, launched the Barrel Full of Cash national promotion. 2,500,000 specially marked promotional packages were produced, 4 of which contained instant cash prizes. One package contained the grand prize $10,000 ticket, and 3 others contained secondary prizes valued each at $3,000, $2,000 and $1,000.</p>
<p>My agency, <a href="http://www.ccmthinkimpact.com" target="_blank">CCM Marketing</a>, was in charge of administering the promotion, and I was assigned with building a microsite to both house all information related to the promotion, and feature a sweepstakes entry form to give consumers a second chance to win.</p>
<p>I decided to break the site into two main areas:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>Information related to the in-pack instant win game</li>
	<li>Information related to the online sweepstakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The home page featured two large button where the user could explore either area.</p>
<p>The site also featured a left column navigation with 3 buttons:
<ol>
	<li>To return home</li>
	<li>To enter the sweepstakes</li>
	<li>To view the official rules</li>
</ol>
<p>The site using the CodeIgniter PHP framework. Logic was added to ensure that entries were only received during the time allowed in the official rules, and that only one entry was received per participant. An opt-in box was also included in the entry form to build the brand&#39;s email database.</p>
<p>The sweepstakes ran for a 3 month period, during which it received over 70,000 entries. The site is still live, and while sweepstakes entry is closed, at the time of writing this there are still 3 unclaimed instant cash prizes.</p>
